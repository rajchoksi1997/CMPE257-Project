# Comparative Study of Machine Learning models in Drought Prediction

Agriculture is an important part of US economy. According to US government agriculture contributed $1.5 trillion to the economy in 2020 which is a 5% share. However global warming and changes in climate leads to significant drought in various parts of the country which adversely affects agriculture. Hence by leveraging machine learning we can help farmers in taking preventive measures and minimize their loss. 

Our aim is to provide a comparative study on the performance of different machine learning models in predicting the possibilities of drought using meteorological data. We aim to use supervised learning models such as Random Forest, Decision Tree, KNN and naive bayes for the comparative study. We will be using data from [US drought monitor](https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/DmData/DataDownload.aspx) and [nasaâ€™s power project](https://power.larc.nasa.gov/) which provides drought and meteorological data.

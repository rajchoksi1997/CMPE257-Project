# Comparative Study of Machine Learning models in Drought Prediction

Agriculture is an important part of the US economy. According to the US government agriculture contributed $1.5 trillion to the economy in 2020 which is a 5% share. However global warming and changes in climate leads to significant drought in various parts of the country which adversely affects agriculture. Unlike other natural disasters, Drought develops slowly and has long term consequences. Hence by leveraging machine learning we can help farmers in taking preventive measures and minimize their loss. 

Our aim is to provide a comparative study on the performance of different machine learning models in predicting five levels of drought ranging from moderate to extreme using meteorological data. Weather conditions and precipitation levels at different heights from the sea level will play an important indicators for predicting droughts. We aim to use supervised learning models such as Random Forest, Decision Tree, KNN and naive bayes for the study and compare their results using performance metrics such as F1 score, accuracy, recall, precision and ROC curve.  

We will be using dataset from the [US drought monitor](https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/DmData/DataDownload.aspx) which provides drought and meteorological data.
